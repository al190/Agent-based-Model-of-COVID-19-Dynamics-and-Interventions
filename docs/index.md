## Purpose

This repository implements an agent-based simulation to study COVID-19 spread and evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing, isolation, and contact tracing.

## Features

- Individual-based agents with health states (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered)
- Configurable intervention strategies and timelines
- Output metrics for cases, hospitalizations, and intervention effects
- Scripts to run simulations and produce visualizations

## Quick start (local)

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+ (or the version used by the project)
- pip

Steps:
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/al190/Agent-based-Model-of-COVID-19-Dynamics-and-Interventions.git
2. Change to the project directory:

   cd Agent-based-Model-of-COVID-19-Dynamics-and-Interventions
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
4. Install dependencies (if a requirements file exists):

   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the main simulation script (adjust command if different in your repo):

   python run_simulation.py

Check the repository README for exact filenames and usage details.

## Results & visualizations

Simulation outputs (CSV/plots) are generated by the repository's analysis scripts. See the code and notebooks in the repo for how to reproduce published figures.
